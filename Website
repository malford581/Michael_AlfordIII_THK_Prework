<h1>Michael Alford III</h1>
<p><b>Why are you interested in becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow?</b></p>
<p> I've always been interested in web development and data science so I did some research and attempted to learn it on my own. It didn't work out as I anticipated because I didn't have someone to explain the information when I got confused. I feel like the TKH Fellowship program will not only teach me coding, but it will be launching pad for a career on the coding field. </p>

<p>My goal for 2020 is to complete The Knowledge House Innovation Fellowship and begin working in the tech deparment of a major production studio like Disney, Viacom, etc.</p>
